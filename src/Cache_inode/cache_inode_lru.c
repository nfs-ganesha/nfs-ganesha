 * @brief Constant-time cache inode cache management implementation
 */

/**
 * @page LRUOverview LRU Overview
 *
 * This module implements a constant-time cache management strategy
 * based on LRU.  Some ideas are taken from 2Q [Johnson and Shasha 1994]
 * and MQ [Zhou, Chen, Li 2004].  In this system, cache management does
 * interact with cache entry lifecycle, but the lru queue is not a garbage
 * collector. Most imporantly, cache management operations execute in constant
 * time, as expected with LRU (and MQ).
 *
 * Cache entries in use by a currently-active protocol request (or other
 * operation) have a positive refcount, and threfore should not be present
 * at the cold end of an lru queue if the cache is well-sized.
 *
 * Cache entries with lock and open state are not eligible for collection
 * under ordinary circumstances, so are kept on a separate lru_pinned
 * list to retain constant time.
 *
 * The locking discipline for this module is complex, because an entry
 * LRU can either be found through the cache entry in which it is
 * embedded (through a hash table or weakref lookup) or one can be
 * found on the queue.  Thus, we have some sections for which locking
 * the entry then the queue is natural, and others for which locking
 * the queue then the entry is natural.  Because it is the most common
 * case in request processing, we have made the lock the queue case
 * the defined lock order.
 *
 * This introduces some complication, particularly in the case of
 * cache_inode_lru_get and the repaer thread, which access entries
 * through their queue.  Therefore, we introduce the following rules
 * for accessing LRU entries:
 *
 *    - The LRU refcount may be increased by a thread holding either
 *      the entry lock or the lock for the queue holding the entry.
 *    - The entry flags may be set or inspected only by a thread
 *      holding the lock on that entry.
 *    - An entry may only be removed from or inserted into a queue by
 *      a thread holding a lock on both the entry and the queue.
 *    - A thread may only decrement the reference count while holding
 *      the entry lock.
 *    - A thread that wishes to decrement the reference count must
 *      check that the reference count is greater than
 *      LRU_SENTINEL_REFCOUNT and, if not, acquire the queue lock
 *      before decrementing it.  When the reference count falls to 0,
 *      the controlling thread will have already acquired the queue
 *      lock.  It must then set the LRU_ENTRY_CONDEMNED bit on the
 *      entry's flags, and remove it from the queue.  It must then
 *      drop both the entry and queue lock, call pthread_yield, and
 *      reacquire the entry lock before continuing with disposal.
 *    - A thread wishing to operate on an entry picked from a given
 *      queue fragment must lock that queue fragment, find the entry,
 *      and increase its reference count by one.  It must then store a
 *      pointer to the entry and release the queue lock before
 *      acquiring the entry lock.  If the LRU_ENTRY_CONDEMNED bit is
 *      set, it must relinquish its lock on the entry and attempt no
 *      further access to it.  Otherwise, it must examine the flags
 *      and lane stored in the entry to determine the current queue
 *      fragment containing it, rather than assuming that the original
 *      location is still valid.

 *    consists of taking an entry from L1, examining to see if it is a
 *    regular file not bearing state with an open FD, closing the open
 *    FD if it is, and then moving it to L2.  The advantage of the two
 *    level system is twofold: First, seldom used entries congregate
 *    in L2 and the promotion behaviour provides some scan
 *    resistance.  Second, once an entry is examined, it is moved to
 *    L2, so we won't examine the same cache entry repeatedly.
 *
 *  - If the number of open FDs is greater than the high water mark,
 *    we consider ourselves to be in extremis.  In this case we make a
 *    number of passes through the queue not to exceed the number of
 *    passes that would be required to process the number of entries
 *    equal to a biggest_window percent of the system specified
 *    maximum.
 *
 *  - If we are in extremis, and performing the maximum amount of work
 *    allowed has not moved the open FD count required_progress%
 *    toward the high water mark, increment lru_state.futility.  If
 *    lru_state.futility reaches futility_count, temporarily disable
 *    FD caching.
 *
 *  - Every time we wake through timeout, reset futility_count to 0.
 *
 *  - If we fall below the low water mark and FD caching has been
 *    temporarily disabled, re-enable it.
