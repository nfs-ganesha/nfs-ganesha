0.99.39 - Mon 21 Jul 2008
	- Initial version submitted to sourceforge

0.99.40 - Mon 28 Jul 2008 
	- Fixed several memory issues in NFSv4 implementation 
	- Fixed several memory issues in FSAL_PROXY
	- Fixed a badly placed Mem_Free in support/nfs_state_id.c (function nfs4_State_Del)
        - Added Handle Mapping feature in FSAL_PROXY which makes it possible to export
          back in NFSv2 and NFSv3 from a proxyfied server accessed via NFSv4

0.99.41 - Mon 18 Aug 2008
	- Fixed nfs4_op_access bug due to bad interpretation of the RFC for
	  OP_ACCESS4
	- Added extended features in BuddyMalloc module to enable extended
	  memory leak tracking (run the ./configure script with the following
	  options : "--enable-debug-memleaks --disable-block-prealloc")
	- Fixed a bug in FSAL_PROXY that made every user have root permissions
	  in a few situations
	- Bug fixed: bad offset management in FSAL_read/FSAL_write for
	  FSAL_PROXY. This made the datacache behaves weirdly. 
	- Use All-0 stateid for r/w operations made for maintaining the data
	  cache coherent with the "proxyfied" server with FSAL_PROXY. Due to
	  this the parameter NFSv4_Proxy::Open_by_FH_Working_Dir is no more
	  required, making the configuration of nfs-ganesha as a proxy much
	  easier
	- FSAL_PROXY now supports RPCSEC_GSS authentication

0.99.42 - Mon 29 Sep 2008
	- Added xattr support in NFSv4. For object "foo" a ghost
	  directory name ".xattr.d.foo" is used to access extended attributes
        - Added xattr ghost directory and ghost objects for NFSv3. These "extended
	  attributes" are read-only for the moment. These two new features may
          be disable if "--disable-xattr-directory" is used at "./configure" time
        - Enhancement in FSAL_GetXattrs function (file FSAL/FSAL_*/fsal_xattrs.c) for
          making integration to xattr.d easier

0.99.43 - Fri 10 Oct 2008
        - Fixed RPCSEC_GSS support. It is now possible to mount with krb5
	  authentication. Security tuple krb5, krb5i and krb5p are supported
	- Add RPCSEC_GSS specifc feature for NFSv4
	- Add RPCSEC_GSS specifc feature for NFSv3
	- Configuration file supports "nodesets" syntax( the set
     	  "node1,node3,node4,node5,node6" can be summarized as
	  "node[1,3,4-6]). This feature is very useful if your client is a
	  cluster.
	- New RPM packaging. 
	- The libganeshaNFS that provide NFS exports for FUSE ready product is
	  now available as both static and shared libraries. 

0.99.44 - Mon 20 Oct 2008 
        - NFS4_OP_OPEN default behaviour is now to ask the client to confirm 
	  the open using NFS5_OP_OPEN_CONFIRM. The default behaviour was
	  formerly the opposite.
	- A bug in NFS4_OP_OPEN : same open_owner could have multiple states
	  on the same file in certain cases 
	- Many bug fixed in NFS4_OP_LOCK
	- libganeshaNFS (produced when FSAL_FUSELIKE is chosen) can now be
	  managed by pkgconfig (a ".pc" file is added to the install target)
	- Improved compatibility for old FUSE filesystems that implement getdir
	  instead of readdir.
	- FUSE-like binding now support filesystems with no inode numbers.
	- TIRPC can be use as alternate RPC layer. In later releases, this
	  feature will be used to support IPv6 with NFS-GANESHA.
	- Added a 'init' scripts to be place in /etc/init.d 
	- Added stuff to specfile so that it installs the .vim files

0.99.45 - Wed  5 Nov 2008

0.99.46 - Wed 18 Nov 2008 	
	- Bug fix: possible deadlock may occur in worker thread when using tcp
	  clients
	- Minor feature: MD cache now uses home made RW_Lock (the same that 
	  Hashtable module already uses). Call rw_lock_downgrade was added to
	  RW_Lock module
	- DataCache GC is done by an external call to the ganesha service
	  started in "syncers" of "flushers" mode.

0.99.47 - Thu  4 Dec 2008
	- Running the Spec benchmark on nfs-ganesha showed a bug in attributes
	  asked at creation time in NFSPROC3_CREATE, this has been fixed
	- Fix non-compliancy (thanks again to Spec NFS) in NFSPROC3_SYMLINK (attributes provided as 
	  arguments were never used).
	- Code cleanup: removed structure related to deprecated way of
	  performing datacache's garbagge collection.
	- Major feature added : skeleton and "basements" added for MFSL, a
	  new module that goes between md cache and FSAL 
	- Removed direct Cache_Inode_Async, md writeback will be provided in a
	  future module MFSL_ASYNC in MFSL directory 
	 
0.99.48	- Mon 15 Dec 2008
	- Renamed yyparse and yylex functions so that GANESHA/FUSE would no
	  more interfer with FUSE modules that uses lex/yacc parsing
	- FSAL_PROXY was ported to MacOS X (Darwin 9.5.0)

        - MySQL can be used instead of PGSQL in FSAL_POSIX. It becomes the
  	  default database for this FSAL.
	- Bug Fix: Massive and parralel mount requests (e.g. : all nodes of a
	  compute cluster starting at the same time after a maintenance) could
	  lead to errors on client. This "denial of service" like trouble has
	  been fixed.

        - Bug Fix in the non-regression test suite (badly managed
	  configuration file)
	- Bug Fix: in MFSL_ASYNC, an entry is not looked up by cache_inode
	  layer if its parent is asynchronous, this will prevent from an
	  encountered incoherency (this issue was discovered with cthon's
	  basic test3)
	- Bug Fix: in MFSL_ASYNC, numlinks was badly managed in MFSL_unlink,
	  files with numlinks >1 were deleted by MFSL_unlink
	- Bug Fix: in MFSL_ASYNC, symbolic links can't be proceeded
	  asynchronously. Mechanism were added to bypass the asynchronous
	  management for this specific case

	  credentials provided by the caller
	- FSAL_POSIX uses pread/pwrite instead of fseek+fwrite/fseek+fread
	- NFSv4 implementation now supports NFSv4 referrals
	
0.99.54 - Mon 22 Jun 2009
	- Bug Fixed in NFSV4 lock management : NFS4ERR_OPENMODE was not 
	  returned in case a WRITE lock was requested on a read-only file 
	- Bug fixed in NFSv4 lock management : previously know lockowner where 
	  badly managed. 
	- Bug fixed in NFSv4 lock management : NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID was
 	  returned instead of NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID in severals cases
	- Update nfs4_op_open's behaviour related to NFS4ERR_SHARE_DENIED
	- Update nfs4_op_write and nfs4_op_read behavior regardings locks and
	  share reservations.

	  open-stateids for managing seqid at state transition
	- better management of OPEN4 with EXCLIVE4 repeated with same verifier
	- Return NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when closing a file with held locks

	- Minor bug fixed in nfs4_op_open_confirm (errors when bad arguments
	  are used)
	- bad seqid management in nfs4_op_close
	- Fix bug in the use of ACCES4resok::supported flag
	- MFSL_ASYNC now has startup routines to clean preallocated stuff left
	  by older instance of the server
	- Bug Fix in OP_OPEN4 : if the file already existed as an
	  OPEN_CREATE operation was made with the UNCHECKED mode, the parent
	  directory remain as the cfh as the operation returned NFS4_OK,
	  leading to lots of mess about the file. 

0.99.55 -Tue 30 Jun 2009 
	- Stupid bug fix in nfs4_op_open.c (allocating a zero length
	  buffer...)
	- Bug fix in OP_LOCKU4 implementation : no stateid was returned	
	- cache_inode_setattr was modified so that cache_inode_setattr can 
	  set the size of a file (by calling FSAL_setattr). This is required 
	  for a correct implementation of OP_OPEN4
	- Lots of problems were met when implementing NFSv4 state mechanism
	  and work is still in progress. To provide users with usable NFSv4
	  exports, a "rather stateless" model has been implemented. More
	  complex implementation of NFSv4 state modelscan be activated by
	  using "--enable-nfs4-stateid" at ./configure time. In this last
	  case, the targeted client is 2.6.29-4 (Fedora11).

	- Minor change in rpcxid dupreq management
	- Fix bad default parameters in config_samples/proxy.ganesha.nfsd.conf
	- Add config file parameter NFSv4::DomainName (formerly domain was
	  alway "localdomain" which was a big lack of flexibility)
	- Add macro %tmp_install_dir to spec file to avoid using dirty
	  variable TMP_INSTALL_DIR
	- Add optional use of nfsidmap library 

0.99.60 - Mon 30 Nov 2009
	- The uid/gid mapping functions did a bad use of their related
	  idmapper_cache functions (the cache was not used in several cases)
	- Bug Fix : with kernel newer than 2.6.29, Connectathon's test6 failed
	  on NFSv4 and NFSv4.1. This is now fixed : eod is returned only when
	  the array of requested entries is empty (no more entry to be read in
	  the directory).
	- Lock supports goes successfully through BULL's locktest when used 
	  on top of NFSv4.1 (problems remains with NFSv4.0)
	- Bug Fix: NFSv4 rsize/wsize had always value 1024 that killed
	  performances.
	- Bug Fix : in nfsv4, the same open_owner opening a previously opened
	  fileid did not get the same stateid.

1.1.0   - Wed  7 Apr 2011
        - Bug Fix: Bad memset in FSAL_HPSS::HPSSFSAL_lookup. Result was a segfault at init.
	- Code reorganization : subdirectory RPCAL has been added
	- Bug fixe : bad 'fd2handle' options in FSAL_XFS::FSAL_rename
        - Log: new log levels LogFatal, LogCleanup added  
	- TIRPC now supports the RPCSEC_GSS feature

          Attention: there are changes to be done in the configuration file
        - Bug Fix: issue occured in 'Tbl' pass of cthon04 test for FSAL_XFS and FSAL_VFS because 
          of a badly managed opened fd. This is now fixed.
        - NFSv4 ACLs support
        - GPFS ACLs support (to be used with NFSv4 ACL support)

1.1.1  - Fri 11 Nov 2011 
       - Bug Fix: padded size for FSAL-less daemon were too short and not aligned on 64 bits

1.3.0 - Fri 23 Dec 2011
       - Lustre FSAL: exporting several Lustre filesystem with the same server instance
       - A bug was found (during Bake-A-thon) and fix in OP4_READDIRPLUS (leading to missing
         directory's entries)
       - Directory content cached is now managed as a tree. Formerly used
         dir_chain were removed.
       - Lock support for FSAL_LUSTRE
