#
# It is possible to use FSAL_CEPH to provide an NFS gateway to CephFS. The
# following sample config should be useful as a starting point for
# configuration. This basic configuration is suitable for a standalone NFS
# server, or an active/passive configuration managed by some sort of clustering
# software (e.g. pacemaker, docker, etc.).
#
# Note too that it is also possible to put a config file in RADOS, and give
# ganesha a rados URL from which to fetch it. For instance, if the config
# file is stored in a RADOS pool called "nfs-ganesha", in a namespace called
# "ganesha-namespace" with an object name of "ganesha-config":
#
# %url	rados://nfs-ganesha/ganesha-namespace/ganesha-config
#
# If we only export cephfs (or RGW), store the configs and recovery data in
# RADOS, and mandate NFSv4.1+ for access, we can avoid any sort of local
# storage, and ganesha can run as an unprivileged user (even inside a
# locked-down container).
