/**
 * @page FSAL_PNFS How to pNFS enable your FSAL
 *
 * Meta-data server
 * ================
 *
 * Your FSAL must indicate to callers that it supports pNFS.  Ensure
 * that the @c fs_supports method returns @c true when queried with
 * @c fso_pnfs_mds_supported.
 *
 * You must implement @c getdeviceinfo on the export and may impelment
 * @c getdevicelist, if you wish.  To let clients know what layouts
 * they may request, be sure to implement @c fs_layouttypes.  You
 * should implement @c fs_maximum_segments to inform the protocol
 * layer the maximum number of segments you will ever provide for a
 * single layoutget call.  (The current Linux kernel only supports one
 * segment per LAYOUTGET, unfortunately, so that's a good maximum for
 * now.)  Other hints for the protocol layer are @c fs_loc_body_size
 * (to determine how much space it will allocate for your loc_body XDR
 * stream) and @c fs_da_addr_size (the same thing for da_addr).
 *
 * On @c fsal_obj_handle, you should implement @c layoutget, @c
 * layoutreturn, and @c layoutcommit.  If you want to be able to
 * recall layouts, you will need to send a request of the type
 * @c FSAL_UP_EVENT_LAYOUTRECALL with @c fsal_up_submit.  For details,
 * see the documentation for the FSAL Upcall System.
 *
 * Data server
 * ===========
 *
 * This is only relevant if you are using the LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES
 * layouts.  If you are using OSD or Object layouts, or plan to use an
 * spNFS-like configuration employing na√≠ve data servers, you do not
 * need to worry about this.
 *
 * Your FSAL must indicate to callers that it supports pNFS DS
 * operations.  Ensure that the @c fs_supports method returns @c true
 * when queried with @c fso_pnfs_ds_supported.
 *
 * You must implement the @c make_ds_handle method on the pNFS DS.
 * This must create an object of type @c fsal_ds_handle from the NFS
 * handle supplied as part of your layout.  See the @c fsal_ds_handle
 * documentation for details.  You must implement the @c release, @c
 * read, @c write, and @c commit methods.
