 *
 * This file's purpose is to allow us to easily replace the memory
 * allocator used by Ganesha.  Further, it provides a pool abstraction
 * that may be implemented in terms of the normal allocator that may
 * be expanded at a later date.  These are intended to be thin
 * wrappers, but conditionally compiled trace information could be
 * added.
