 *
 * @section structs Public and Private Data Structures
 *
 * Shared FSAL data structures have two definitions, one that is
 * global and passed around by the core, the other private which
 * included the global definition within it.
 *
 * All these data structures are passed back to the core with the
 * global pointer and dereferenced with container_of within the FSAL
 * itself like so:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 *
 * struct private_obj_handle
 * {
 *         [private stuff]
 *         struct fsal_obj_handle *pub;
 * }
 *
 * fsal_getattr(struct fsal_obj_handle handle_pub)
 * {
 *         struct private_obj_handle *handle;
 *
 *         handle = container_of(handle_pub,
 *                               struct private_obj_handle, pub);
 *         [ do stuff ]
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The @c container_of macro takes the public pointer/handle @c
 * handle_pub which is indicated as the element @c pub of structure
 * type @c private_obj_handle.  Throughout the function, where private
 * elements are dereferenced, the @c handle pointer is used.  The @c
 * handle_pub pointer is used in the public case.
 *
 * @section usage Object usage
 *
 * Mutex locks and reference counts are used to manage both concurrent
 * usage and state.  The reference counts are use to determine when
 * the object is "free".  Current use is for managing ref counts and
 * lists.  This will be expanded, though many cases are already
 * handled by the locks in Cache inode.
 *
 * Since we cannot create objects out of thin air, there is an order
 * based on one object being the "context" in which the other is
 * created.  In other words, a @c fsal_export is created from the @c
 * fsal_module that connects it to the backing store (filesystem). The
 * same applies to a @c fsal_obj_handle that only makes sense for a
 * specific 'fsal_export'.
 *
 * When an object is created, it is returned with a reference already
 * taken.  The callee of the creating method must then either keep a
 * persistent reference to it or @c put it back.  For example, a @c
 * fsal_export gets created for each export in the configuration.  A
 * pointer to it gets saved in @c gsh_export and it has a reference
 * to reflect this.  It is now safe to use it to do a @c lookup which
 * will return a @c fsal_obj_handle which can then be kept in a cache
 * inode entry.  If we had done a @c put on the export, it could be
 * freed at any point and make a @c lookup using it unsafe.
 *
 * In addition to a reference count, object that create other objects
 * have a list of all the objects they create.  This serves two
 * purposes. The obvious case is to keep the object "busy" until all
 * of its children are freed.  Second, it provides a means to visit
 * all of the objects it creates.
 *
 * Every object has a pointer to its parent.  This is used for such
 * things as managing the object list and for calling methods on the
 * parent.
 *
 * @section versioning Versioning
 *
 * One intent in this API is to be able to support fsals that are built
 * out-of-tree and possibly out of synch with the core of Ganesha.  This
 * is managed by version numbers in this file that are validated at load
 * time for the fsal.  There are major and minor version numbers which are
 * monotonically increasing numbers ( V1 < V2 means V2 is newer).
 *
 * API guarantee:
 *
 * * If major version numbers differ, the fsal will not be loaded because
 *   the api has changed enough to make it unsafe.
 *
 * * If the major versions are equal, the minor version determines loadability.
 *
 *   - A fsal that is older than the Ganesha core can safely load and run.
 *
 *   - A fsal that is newer than the Ganesha core is not safe and will not
 *     be loaded.
 *
 *
 * @section vector Operation Vectors
 *
 * Each structure carries with it an @c ops pointer.  Default
 * operation vectors are created at FSAL moduel initialziation time,
 * and may be overridden there.  Individual exports or handles may
 * have different operations vectors, but they should all be derived
 * from the module operations vector.
 *
 *	This vector is used to access methods e.g.:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * exp_hdl->exp_ops.lookup(exp_hdl, name, ...);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that exp_hdl is used to dereference the method and it is also
 * *always* the first argument to the method/function.  Think of it as
 * the 'this' argument.
 *
 * @section Operation Context
 *
 * Protocol operations have lots of state such as user creds, the
 * export currently in use etc.  Rather than pass all this down the
 * stack we take advantage of the design decision that a protocol
 * operation runs to completion in the thread that dequeued the
 * request from the RPC.  All of the operation state (other than
 * some intermediate results passed as function args) are pointed
 * to by the thread local 'op_ctx'.  This will always point to a
 * valid and initialized 'struct req_op_context'.
 *
 *	Method code can reference through 'op_ctx' e.g.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * if (op_ctx->req_type == 9P) { ... }
 * @endcode
 *

/**
 * @page handles File-Handles and You
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 *
 * In the FSAL, file handles can take four forms.  There is the full,
 * internal handle structure, compose of the @c fsal_obj_handle and
 * the FSAL-private structure that contains it.
 *
 * There is the wire-handle, the FSAL-generated portion of the
 * file handles exchanged between Ganesha and its clients through the
 * FS protocol.  The wire-handle should contain everything necessary
 * to find and use the file even if the file has been completely
 * purged from cache or Ganesha has restarted from nothing.  There may
 * be multiple wire-handles per @c fsal_obj_handle.  The wire-handle
 * is produced by the @c handle_to_wire method on @c fsal_obj_handle.
 * FSALs can produce big endian or little endian wire-handles depending
 * on the architecture.
 *
 * A host-handle is a verion of the wire handle in host endian format.  It is
 * produced from wire-handle by @c wire_to_host to the host's native endian
 * type.  @c fsal_export operation @c create_handle produces a new @c
 * fsal_obj_handle from a host-handle.
 *
 * Finally, there is the handle-key, a portion of the handle that contains
 * all and only information that uniquely identifies the object within
 * the entire FSAL (it is insufficient if it only identifies it within
 * the export or within a filesystem.)  There are two functions that
 * generate a handle-key, one is the @c host_to_key method on @c
 * fsal_export.  It is used to get the key from a host-handle so that
 * it can be looked up in the cache.  The other is @c handle_to_key on
 * @c fsal_obj_handle.  This is used after lookup or some other
 * operation that produces a @c fsal_obj_handle so that it can be
 * stored or looked up in the cache.
 *
 * The invariant to be maintained is that given an @c fsal_obj_handle,
 * obj_hdl, exp_ops.host_to_key(wire_to_host(handle_to_wire(obj_hdl)))
 * is equal to obj_ops->handle_to_key(obj_hdl).
 *
 * History and Details
 * ===================
 *
 * The terminology is confusing here.  The old function names were
 * kept (up to a point), but the semantics differ in ways both subtle
 * and catastrophic. Making matters worse, that the first FSAL written
 * was VFS, where the internal @c file_handle for the syscalls is the
 * whole of the key, opaque, and syscall arg.  This does not imply any
 * equivalence.
 *
 * In the old regime, the only place available to store _anything_ was
 * the handle array in @c cache_entry_t.  People overloaded it with
 * all kinds of rubbish as a result, and the wire-handle, the
 * handle-key, and other stuff get mushed together.  To sort things
 * out,
 *
 * 1. The wire-handle opaque _must_ be enough to re-acquire the cache
 *    entry and its associated @c fsal_obj_handle.  Other than that,
 *    it doesn't matter a whit. The client treats the whole protocol
 *    handle (including what is in the opaque) as an opaque token.
 *
 * 2. The purpose of the @c export_id in the protocol "handle" is to
 *    locate the FSAL that knows what is inside the opaque.  The @c
 *    wire_to_host is an export method for that purpose.  It should
 *    be able to take the wire-handle opaque and translate it into
 *    a host-handle. handle-key should be derived from @c host_to_key
 *    that MDCACHE can use to find an entry.
 *
 * 3. OBSOLETE - cache_inode_get takes an fh_desc argument which is not a
 *    handle but a _key_.  It is used to generate the hash and to do
 *    the secondary key compares.  That is all it is used for.  The
 *    end result _must_ be a cache entry and its associated
 *    @c fsal_obj_handle. See how @c cache_inode_get transitions to
 *    cache_inode_new to see how this works.
 *
 * 4. The @c handle_to_key method, a @c fsal_obj_handle method,
 *    generates a key for the MDCACHE hash table from the contents
 *    of the @c fsal_obj_handle.  It is an analogue of fsal export
 *    @c host_to_key method. Note where it is called to see why it is
 *    there.
 *
 * 5. The @c handle_to_wire method is similar in scope but it is the
 *    inverse of @c wire_to_host.  It's job is to fill in the opaque
 *    part of a protocol handle.  Note that it gets passed a @c gsh_buffdesc
 *    that describes the full opaque storage in whatever protocol
 *    specific structure is used.  It's job is to put whatever it
 *    takes into the opaque so the second and third items in this list
 *    work.
 *
 * 6. Unlike the old API, a @c fsal_obj_handle is part of a FSAL
 *    private structure for the object.  Note that there is no handle
 *    member of this public structure.  The bits necessary to both
 *    create a wire handle and use a filesystem handle go into this
 *    private structure. You can put whatever is required into the
 *    private part.  Since both @c fsal_export and @c fsal_obj_handle
 *    have private object storage, you could even do things like have
 *    a container anchored in the export object that maps the
 *    FSAL-external handle to the filesystem data needed to talk to
 *    the filesystem.  If you need more info to deal with handles
 *    differing due to hard-links, this is where you would put
 *    it.  You would also have some other context in this private data
 *    to do the right thing.  Just make sure there is a way to
 *    disambiguate the multiple cases.  We do have to observe UNIX
 *    semantics here.
 *
 * The upper layers don't care about the private handle data.  All
 * they want is to be able to get something out from the object
 * (result of a lookup) so it can find the object again later.  The
 * obvious case is what you describe in @c nfs[34]_FhandleToCache.  These
 * various methods make that happen.

/**
 * @brief request op context
 *
 * This is created early in the operation with the context of the
 * operation.  The difference between "context" and request parameters
 * or arguments is that the context is derived information such as
 * the resolved credentials, socket (network and client host) data
 * and other bits of environment associated with the request.  It gets
 * passed down the call chain only as far as it needs to go for the op
 * i.e. don't put it in the function/method proto "just because".
 *
 * The lifetime of this structure and all the data it points to is the
 * operation for V2,3 and the compound for V4+.  All elements and what
 * they point to are invariant for the lifetime.
 *
 * If an op context is active, ctx_export MAY be NULL (very rare conditions)
 * but ctx_fullpath and ctx_pseudopath must always be valid. The function
 * init_op_context() assures this and init_op_context() and resum_op_context()
 * are the only functions that can ever set op_ctx to a non-NULL value, and
 * resume_op_context() must be setting it to point to an op context initialized
 * with init_op_context().
 *
 * NOTE: This is an across-the-api shared structure.  Changing it implies a
 *       change in the FSAL API.
 *
 * NOTE: There is a set of functions in fsal.h to initialize and manage the
 *       req_op_context. Please use them...
 *
 * NOTE: Usually a gsh_export is referenced by the req_op_context, it is
 *       expected that a reference to that gsh_export will be held for the
 *       duration of the time it's attached to the req_op_context or the life
 *       of the req_op_context. To this extent, the responsibility to make the
 *       put_gsh_export is now borne by the req_op_context management functions.
 *       Specifically release_op_contextm, clear_op_context_export,
 *       set_op_context_export, set_op_context_export_fsal, and
 *       restore_op_context_export will all call put_gsh_export if there is an
 *       attached export.
 *
 *       The functions that manage a saved_export_context maintain a reference
 *       to the gsh_export and thus discard_op_context_export will clean that
 *       up since the saved req_op_context will not be restored.
 *
 * NOTE: In support of exports having fullpath and pseudopath changeable,
 *       those strings are now accessed by gsh_refstr. In order to simplify
 *       the bulk of access to those strings for op_cxt->ctx_export, whenever
 *       ctx_export is changed, proper references to those strings are taken
 *       and stored in the req_op_context. Since those references can not be
 *       changed by any other thread, they are safe to access without RCU
 *       protection. Further if for any reason, those strings are not available,
 *       particularly when no export is attached, a reference to a "No Export"
 *       string is taken, so it is ALWAYS safe to use these strings, there is
 *       ALWAYS a valid reference which is safe to use in the context of the
 *       thread owning the req_op_context. There are a set of functions that
 *       make it easy to access these strings, and to access the "best" string
 *       in the context of which string is used for NFS v3 MOUNT requests.

/**
 * @brief Minimal emergency cleanup on error
 *
 * This method is called only in the event of a catastrophic
 * failure. Currently, it will be called if some detail of the orderly
 * shutdown fails, so that FSALs will have the opportunity to leave
 * their underlying filesystems in a consistent state. It may at some
 * later time be called in the event of a crash. The majority of FSALs
 * will have no need to implement this call and should not do so.
 *
 * This function should, if implemented:
 *
 * 1. Do the bare minimum necessary to allow access to the each
 * underlying filesystem it serves. (the equivalent of a clean
 * unmount, so that a future instance of Ganesha or other tool can
 * mount the filesystem without difficulty.) How the FSAL defines
 * 'underlying filesystem' is FSAL specific. The FSAL handle itself
 * has a list of attached exports and that can be traversed if
 * suitable.
 *
 * 2. It /must not/ take any mutices, reader-writer locks, spinlocks,
 * sleep on any condition variables, or similar. Since other threads
 * may have crashed or been cancelled, locks may be left held,
 * overwritten with random garbage, or be similarly awful. The point
 * is to shut down cleanly, and you can't shut down cleanly if you're
 * hung. This does not create a race condition, since other threads in
 * Ganesha will have been cancelled by this point.
 *
 * 3. If it is at all possible to avoid, do not allocate memory on the
 * heap or use other services that require the user space to be in a

 * descriptor" even is. Ultimately, it is whatever the FSAL needs in
 * order to manage the share reservations and lock state.
 *
 * The open2 method also allows atomic create/setattr/open (just like the
 * NFS v4 OPEN operation).
 *
 */

/**
 * @brief Open a file descriptor for read or write and possibly create
 *
 * This function opens a file for read or write, possibly creating it.
 * If the caller is passing a state, it must hold the state_lock
 * exclusive.
 *
 * state can be NULL which indicates a stateless open (such as via the
 * NFS v3 CREATE operation), in which case the FSAL must assure protection
 * of any resources. If the file is being created, such protection is
 * simple since no one else will have access to the object yet, however,
 * in the case of an exclusive create, the common resources may still need
 * protection.
 *
 * If Name is NULL, obj_hdl is the file itself, otherwise obj_hdl is the
 * parent directory.
 *
 * On an exclusive create, the upper layer may know the object handle
 * already, so it MAY call with name == NULL. In this case, the caller
 * expects just to check the verifier.
 *
 * On a call with an existing object handle for an UNCHECKED create,
 * we can set the size to 0.
 *
 * At least the mode attribute must be set if createmode is not FSAL_NO_CREATE.
 * Some FSALs may still have to pass a mode on a create call for exclusive,
 * and even with FSAL_NO_CREATE, and empty set of attributes MUST be passed.
 *
 * If an open by name succeeds and did not result in Ganesha creating a file,
 * the caller will need to do a subsequent permission check to confirm the
 * open. This is because the permission attributes were not available
 * beforehand.
 *
 * The caller is expected to invoke fsal_release_attrs to release any
 * resources held by the set attributes. The FSAL layer MAY have added an
 * inherited ACL.
 *
 * The caller will set the request_mask in attrs_out to indicate the attributes
 * of interest. ATTR_ACL SHOULD NOT be requested and need not be provided. If
 * not all the requested attributes can be provided, this method MUST return
 * an error unless the ATTR_RDATTR_ERR bit was set in the request_mask.
 *
 * Since this method may instantiate a new fsal_obj_handle, it will be forced
 * to fetch at least some attributes in order to even know what the object
 * type is (as well as it's fileid and fsid). For this reason, the operation
 * as a whole can be expected to fail if the attributes were not able to be
 * fetched.
 *
 * The attributes will not be returned if this is an open by object as
 * opposed to an open by name.
