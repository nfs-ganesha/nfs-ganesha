/**
 *
 * @brief Implements parent lookup functionality
 *
 * Looks up (and caches) the parent directory for a directory.  If an
 * entry is returned, that entry's refcount is incremented by one.
 * The caller must hold a reference on the entry.  It is expected that
 * the caller holds the directory lock on entry.  It is also expected
 * that the caller will relinquish the directory lock after return.
 * If result was not cached, the function will drop the read lock and
 * acquire a write lock so it can add the result to the cache.
 *
 * @note this can behave differently than a local Linux user of the
 * filesystem if the path to get here is a symlink.  In the local
 * case, the path is consistent because the kernel's CWD gets the
 * expected "..".  We don't have that so the ".." is the directory in
 * which the name resides even though the symlink allowed us to skip
 * around the real (non symlink resolved) path.
 *
 * @param[in]  entry   Entry whose parent is to be obtained
 * @param[out] parent  Parent directory
 *
 * @return CACHE_INODE_SUCCESS or errors.
