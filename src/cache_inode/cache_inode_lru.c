 */

/**
 * @page LRUOverview LRU Overview
 *
 * This module implements a constant-time cache management strategy
 * based on LRU.  Some ideas are taken from 2Q [Johnson and Shasha 1994]
 * and MQ [Zhou, Chen, Li 2004].  In this system, cache management does
 * interact with cache entry lifecycle, but the lru queue is not a garbage
 * collector. Most imporantly, cache management operations execute in constant
 * time, as expected with LRU (and MQ).
 *
 * Cache entries in use by a currently-active protocol request (or other
 * operation) have a positive refcount, and threfore should not be present
 * at the cold end of an lru queue if the cache is well-sized.
 *
 * Cache entries with lock and open state are not eligible for collection
 * under ordinary circumstances, so are kept on a separate lru_pinned
 * list to retain constant time.
 *
 * As noted below, initial references to cache entries may only be granted
 * under the cache inode hash table latch.  Likewise, entries must first be
 * made unreachable to the cache inode hash table, then independently reach
 * a refcnt of 0, before they may be disposed or recycled.

 * refcount.  To preserve constant time operation, they are stored in an

/**
 * @brief Function that executes in the lru thread

 * This function performs long-term reorganization, compaction, and

 * and dereferencing.
 *
 * This function is responsible for deferred cleanup of cache entries
 * killed in request or upcall (or most other) contexts.
 *
 * This function is responsible for cleaning the FD cache.  It works
 * by the following rules:
 *
 *  - If the number of open FDs is below the low water mark, do
 *    nothing.
 *
 *  - If the number of open FDs is between the low and high water
 *    mark, make one pass through the queues, and exit.  Each pass
 *    consists of taking an entry from L1, examining to see if it is a
 *    regular file not bearing state with an open FD, closing the open
 *    FD if it is, and then moving it to L2.  The advantage of the two
 *    level system is twofold: First, seldom used entries congregate
 *    in L2 and the promotion behaviour provides some scan
 *    resistance.  Second, once an entry is examined, it is moved to
 *    L2, so we won't examine the same cache entry repeatedly.
 *
 *  - If the number of open FDs is greater than the high water mark,
 *    we consider ourselves to be in extremis.  In this case we make a
 *    number of passes through the queue not to exceed the number of
 *    passes that would be required to process the number of entries
 *    equal to a biggest_window percent of the system specified
 *    maximum.
 *
 *  - If we are in extremis, and performing the maximum amount of work
 *    allowed has not moved the open FD count required_progress%
 *    toward the high water mark, increment lru_state.futility.  If
 *    lru_state.futility reaches futility_count, temporarily disable
 *    FD caching.
 *
 *  - Every time we wake through timeout, reset futility_count to 0.
 *
 *  - If we fall below the low water mark and FD caching has been
 *    temporarily disabled, re-enable it.
 *
 * This function uses the lock discipline for functions accessing LRU
 * entries through a queue partition.
